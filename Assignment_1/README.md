# COMP5329-DeepLearning Assignment 1
University of Sydney Coursework for COMP5329: Deep Learning (Semester 1, 2020)

This assignment was completed as part of the COMP5329 unit of The University of Sydney by [Sanna Nazir](https://github.com/Sanna-Nazir), [Anshu Kumar](https://github.com/anshukr5) and [Samarth Sehgal](https://github.com/samarthsehgal97). 

The motivation and goals underlying this report/project can be categorized into two major brackets:

At its core i.e. microscopically, the project is aimed at enhancing the students technical capabilities with respect to building neural networks from scratch. It also focuses on building the student’s understanding of how a neural network works, and how that mathematical working can be translated into a coded application for implementation. Furthermore, by enforcing implementation of various modules such as dropout, batch normalization, weight decay, SGD momentum etc., this project encourages the student to understand the significance of each of these modules, their impacts on the neural network’s performance metrics as well as the process required to integrate these modules into the code. Thus, at the student/individual level, the aim of this project is to build the technical and analytical skills, pertinent to neural networks, of the student. 

Looking at the bigger picture i.e. the macroscopic level, the project is designed to enhance the understanding and importance of neural networks to current human life. It encourages the student to research and inculcate the broad range of applications for deep neural networks. By building the network from scratch, it also encourages the student to dive deeper into the foundational knowledge of these networks and to build the skill of tailoring neural networks to the application/problem at hand. At a macroscopic level, the project is aimed at understanding the design processes, evaluation metrics and significance of deep learning networks to real-world problems. 

Microscopically, the key tasks of this project are: 

  1. Redefining the provided Multi-Layer Perceptron code
  2. Enhance the MLP using prescribed modules to be implemented 
  3. Analyze and compare the impact of these modules on the network 
  4. Self-reflect on the project and consequent future work.
