# COMP5329-DeepLearning Assignment 2
University of Sydney Coursework for COMP5329: Deep Learning (Semester 1, 2020)

This assignment was completed as part of the COMP5329 unit of The University of Sydney by [Sanna Nazir](https://github.com/Sanna-Nazir), [Anshu Kumar](https://github.com/anshukr5) and [Samarth Sehgal](https://github.com/samarthsehgal97). 

The aim of this project and the report may be divided into two separate levels:

In a big picture view, the assignment/task teaches us the tenets of being a deep learning engineer in a real-world scenario. Image classification is an increasing popular and widely used application of deep neural networks. Furthermore, it is also a widely researched field with major players/companies releasing their own custom built neural networks for greater use by the public. Some examples are: ResNet50, VGG19, AlexNet, ImageNet etc. The task enables us to deploy these efficient, pre-trained networks for our own custom applications and datasets. Thus, at a macroscopic level, the project is aimed at teaching the students essential core skills for building deep learning applications. 

At the course/student level, the project is aimed at inculcating the essential data handling and manipulation skills used in deep learning techniques. The key tasks for this project included handling the large amount of data in an efficient manner, balancing of the imbalanced classes, standardizing the irregular images for feeding the networks, employing existing deep infrastructures for custom applications, understanding the pros and cons of deep learning frameworks (used PyTorch and Tensorflow), evaluating and fine-tuning the metrics of the network and finally creating desirable results. Thus, the aim of the study is to imbibe real-world data learning skills in the students. Along with encouraging the understanding of computer vision field and its diverse applications.
